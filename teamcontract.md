#Team Contract

##Roles
* Taskmaster
* Gitmaster
* Testmaster

##Daily process
* Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster at 9:30
* New roles assigned (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
* Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
* Pair program on more abstract tasks, or when having difficulty
* Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
* At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
* Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master


##Team expectations
  * Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
  * If you want to work from home, work on features that you've been assigned, don't grab someone elses issue
  * If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
  * We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
  * None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
  * Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
  * Share the mic
  * Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
  * At least message the group when you change what you are working on. Use Waffle!

##Issues

* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  * Take 10-15 minute break
  * List out the pros / cons
  * Vote on it (bring in 3rd party)...Senate Rules

##If you are frustrated:
  * Take a walk or get some water
  * Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
  * If frustrated with group, give specific feedback soon after, and make sure to ask for permission before giving feedback
